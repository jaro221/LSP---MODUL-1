Module 1: Dynamic LSP Model Training
This repository contains everything you need to train and evaluate models on time-series data acquired from a Laser Speckle Photometry (LSP) device:

Data pipeline

Raw video streams in .avi format

Automated preprocessing that converts each video into JSON feature files (inputs) and corresponding TXT label files (outputs)

Model training & evaluation

Scripts and configurations to train hybrid CNNâ€“LSTM, multi-branch architectures on the JSON data

End-to-end testing workflows and performance benchmarks
